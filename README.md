# Robot turret

Project description

In my project I make a nerf turret head.

CAD

  Description and takeaways:The CAD for this project went relivively smoothly, with the only issue being cost of prototypeing. I found the best way to get around the high cost was by spliting the main body up into sven parts that bolt together, I also made sideways square holes to limit printing material.

Phisycal assembly and fine tuning

  This project has ALOT of bolts that need to be self threaded into 2.8mm holes. I started putting them in with an alan key, but when I realized that would take a couple decades, I found a bit for the screw gun that would fit the bolts. This sped up the assembly by a ton, just be careful not to strip the plastic threads.
 Once I got the orginal prototype done, i tested it. I imdeiatly ran into issues with the pusher notgetting past the feed lips of the magazine. Once that problam was solved by modifying the pusher into a narrow, rectangular shape, I ran into the problem off there not being anought travel in the pusher to push the dart ton the fly wheels. This was solved by a complete redesign on Onshape of the pusher and wheel. In order to allow the pusher to retract as far as it needed to, I had to bolt acrylic guides onto the guide channel. Once all this was sorted out, I ran into the problem of the servo not being strong enough to push darts out of the spring tension of a loaded magazine. I solved this by taking the spring out of the magazine and leaveing the follower, relying on gravity to carry the darts out of the magazine. After this, it worked like a charm.
